Terraform Hub-Spoke Architecture on Azure
=========================================

This practical project provisions a Hub-and-Spoke network topology on Microsoft Azure using Terraform, deployed through Azure DevOps pipelines. It is a production-ready solution designed for professional environments, aligned with security best practices, and suitable for use as a technical reference, skill development platform, or experimentation space. The implementation follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, incorporating remote backend state management, CI/CD automation, and seamless integration between a local development environment and a GitHub repository to ensure efficient and reliable delivery. Successful deployment requires a solid understanding of Terraform, the Azure cloud platform, DevOps workflows, and YAML syntax for pipeline configuration.

## **Features**

‚Ä¢ Hub-and-Spoke network architecture with centralized routing, traffic management, private DNS, and enhanced security posture
‚Ä¢ VNet peering between Hub and Spoke for seamless and secure cross-network communication
‚Ä¢ Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall rules for comprehensive traffic control
‚Ä¢ Automated deployment of Linux and Windows VMs using cloud-init
‚Ä¢ Azure DNS zones and A record management for internal and external name resolution
‚Ä¢ Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN connection setup for secure remote access
‚Ä¢ Option to configure Local Network Gateway for Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connectivity
‚Ä¢ Azure monitoring for centralized diagnostics and insights
‚Ä¢ Remote state management leveraging Azure Blob Storage for Terraform backend
‚Ä¢ Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline implemented via Azure DevOps

Getting Started
------------------
‚úÖ **Prerequisites**

* Azure Subscription
* Terraform CLI installed
* Azure DevOps Project
* Azure Storage Account configured for remote backend
* Service Principal with Contributor or Owner access
* Service Connection created using the correct Service Principal, scoped to the appropriate folder and Azure DevOps project
* agent configuration at local desktop (I have used lower case 'a' instead of 'A')
* Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords in .tfvars files committed to the repo; use Azure DevOps Variable Groups instead. 

Deployment Steps
-------------------

> In this project, setting up the development environment is a step-by-step process that requires a solid understanding of Azure cloud architecture, intelligent network design, and hands-on experience.

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-hubspoke.git (Ensure you replace your-username with the actual username and local directory/folder)
   
   cd \Users\Alam\Desktop (Enter)
   
   cd terraform-hubspoke (Enter)

   PS C:\Users\Alam\Desktop\terraform-hubspoke>

3. Create terraform.tfvars file:
   location       = "australiaeast"
   admin_username = "azureuser"
   admin_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"

4. Run Terraform Locally (Optional)
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply

5. CI/CD via Azure DevOps
   Push changes to main branch. Pipeline in azure-pipelines.yml triggers automatically.

### Security

* Sensitive variables such as `admin_password` are securely managed using Azure DevOps Variable Groups
* `.terraform/` and `.tfvars` files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive or stateful data
* The infrastructure codebase is organized into segmented and modular `.tf` files, promoting clarity, easier troubleshooting, and maintainability
